I am very pleased to inform you about the new DOS/32 Advanced web site.
The new site is located at http://dos32a.sourceforge.net, and will be the central head quarters that will coordinate the forthcomming new 8.00 version.
DOS/32 Advanced is freely available in the mentioned site with its binaries, source code and documentation. You can get the stable/final 7.10 version (original Narech Koumar release), as wll as the new development/beta 8.00 version. 


About DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender is a state-of-the-art, high-performance, high-speed, true "Plug&Play" replacement of the world's most popular DOS Extender, DOS/4GW, created by Tenberry Software (formerly Rational Systems Inc.) for WATCOM C/C++ and FORTRAN 77 compilers which allow DOS Extended applications to run in a 32-bit flat protected mode environment.
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender provides full compatibility with WATCOM C/C++ and OpenWatcom C/C++ featuring one of the most complete software emulations of DOS/4GW, thus allowing the users to "plug" DOS/32 Advanced into the protected mode programs which use DOS/4G, DOS/4GW, DOS/4GW Professional and any other compatible DOS Extenders without the need in modifying a single line of code.
DOS/32 Advanced has been designed and optimized to be the fastest, most flexible and highly compatible with other software DOS Extender. It performs mode translating operations, such as Protected to Real and Real To Protected mode switching, as fast as machine's hardware allow, and while being compatible with DOS/4GW, it is the fastest DOS Extender that supports WATCOM C/C++ at this time! A large number of configuration options allow DOS/32 Advanced to be configured in hundreds different ways, either by a special environment variable or by an external setup program, giving its users the ability to manually adjust the number of allocated selectors, callbacks, virtual stacks, turn off the exception handling, change the size of DOS transfer buffer and much, much more. Compatibility with "Clean" (also known as "Raw" or INT 15h), XMS, VCPI and DPMI system softwares allows DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender to run on different machines with various operating systems installed. Additionally, availability of such features as Null-Pointer Protection, Extended Memory Blocks Checking and support for built-in Debug Mode turns DOS/32 Advanced into a powerful tool for protected mode programmers who want to make their 32-bit protected mode applications error-free.


About DOS/32 Advanced Team
The newly founded DOS/32 Advanced Team is coordinated by Javier Gutierrez, and is open to any developer that want to contribute to the project.
Its intention is to improve the excellent DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender in order to be freely available to OpenWatcom users, and also to the Watcom C/C++ legacy users by giving them a fast, small and free DOS Extender replacement for the DOS4/GW family.
