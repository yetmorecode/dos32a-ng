	The  DPMI Kernel Configuration Window allows you to change DOS/32 Advanced built-in
	DPMI  Kernel configuration. Please note that  DOS/32 Advanced built-in DPMI server
	will  be installed when running under "Clean", XMS and VCPI system softwares
	only.  This  means  that the options specified  in  this  window will not be
	applicable when running under Windows, OS/2 or any other DPMI hosted system.

<B>VCPI/DPMI Detection Mode</B> <I>Default: VCPI/DPMI</I><BR>
Controls the order of VCPI/DPMI detection. When set to VCPI/DPMI, the DOS
Extender will look for a VCPI server first, and if found, initialize
and  use  it,  even  though  a DPMI host  may  be  present  in the system. The
advantage  of doing so is that the VCPI servers are usually faster than DPMI
hosts.  On the other hand, a DPMI host may always deny the presence of VCPI,
and in that case the DPMI will be detected and initialized instead.

<B>Internal Exception Control</B> <I>Default: ON</I><BR>
When turned on, DOS/32 Advanced will trap down the exceptions thrown in a
protected  mode  program and report them to  the  user. When turned off, the
user's  application  will be responsible for  exception handling. Note that when
the  internal  exception control is turned  off, the interrupts installed by
DPMI  functions  0203h and 0205h will be  installed as is, that is they will
not  be buffered by the DOS Extender  but set directly in the IDT (Interrupt
Descriptor  Table).  Furthermore,  the real mode  IRQ  callbacks will not be
installed automatically by the DOS Extender if this option is turned off.
</FONT></P>

<B>VCPI SmartPage Allocation Mode</B> <I>Default: ON</I><BR>
When  this option is turned on, the  DOS Extender will try to be a little
smart  when  allocating  Page Tables  under VCPI.  It  will  first  retrieve  the
information  about  how much memory is  available in the first VCPI Page Table,
which  always  maps  the  first  four  megabytes  of  memory,  including the
conventional memory under 1MB, and then map the extended memory it allocated
into the free pages in this same Page Table. This way, if you have 16MB of
memory   in  your  computer,  and  3MB  of  that memory  are  used  by,  say
<I>smartdrv.exe</I>  and  other TSRs, the DOS  Extender  will allocate only three
additional  Page Tables to map the rest of the memory, ie 13MB, into them and
into  VCPI  first  Page Table.  This  will  in  most  cases  save  you  4KB of
conventional (DOS) memory when  running under VCPI.  Turn this option off if
you  are  having  problems with a VCPI  server  or if you want your extended
memory  to start at 4MB under VCPI  (when turned off, the DOS Extender will
not  modify  the first Page Table and  will  start mapping the physical memory
into linear memory at 4MB, as does DOS/4GW).
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>VCPI+XMS Allocation Scheme</B> <I>Default: ON</I><BR>
When turned on, the DOS Extender  will allocate the extended memory from the both
VCPI and XMS memory pools, when running under the VCPI system software.
That  is, when you have <I>emm386.exe</I>  installed with <I>ram nnn</I> option, where
"<I>nnn</I>"  is  the number of KB to reserve  for EMS's use, the DOS Extender will
allocate  <I>nnn</I> KB of extended memory from  VCPI and the rest of the memory,
if  any,  from  XMS. Otherwise, when turned  off,  only  VCPI memory will be
allocated by the DOS Extender.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Trap and Report Emulated IRQs</B> <I>Default: ON</I><BR>
When  turned on, the DOS Extender will  trap and report to the user (exit
with  an  error  message) any software  interrupts  that have been issued to
emulate  the  hardware interrupts, IRQs. For  example, if a program issues a
software  interrupt INT 08h to emulate hardware interrupt IRQ 0 (timer), the
DOS  Extender  will  report run-time  error  6001, unexpected interrupt 08h.
Otherwise,  when  this option is turned off,  the DOS Extender will send the
software interrupts to the interrupt handlers installed for the hardware IRQs.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Extended Memory Blocks Checking</B> <I>Default: ON</I><BR>
When  this option is turned on,  the  DOS Extender will check whether the
Extended  Memory Blocks (EMBs), allocated through DPMI functions 05xxh, have
been  overwritten  or  corrupted in some  way.  For  example, imagine that a
program  which allocates 4MB of memory,  and fills the allocated memory area
with  zeroes, has an error. It fills 4MB + 16 bytes area instead of only 4MB
area.  This way, the extended memory  block header, which is placed directly
after the allocated 4MB block will be overwritten, and the DOS Extender will
not be able to allocate the next extended memory block. This situation often
arises when a program is not correctly written and often causes applications
to  crash.  However,  DOS/32 Advanced will,  when  this option is turned on,
always  check and report a run-time  error message when a program overwrites
the memory it had not allocated.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Ignore DOS/4G API Extension Calls</B> <I>Default: OFF</I><BR>
When this option is turned on,  DOS/32 Advanced built-in DPMI server will
fail  any  calls to the DPMI function  0A00h  with DS:ESI pointing to DOS/4G
ID-string  "<I>RATIONAL  DOS/4G</I>".  This way  you  can fool certain applications
which  otherwise  use DOS/4G extensions, and  allow them to run under DOS/32
Advanced  by  telling  them they run  under  DOS/4G incompatible DPMI server
which  will  force  them to not to  use  DOS/4G extensions. Please note that
DOS/32  Advanced  DPMI extensions (called  with  ID-string "<I>SUNSYS DOS/32A</I>")
will work fine no matter whether this option is on or off.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Selectors</B> <I>Default: 256</I><BR>
This is the number of selectors that will be allocated by the DOS Extender
in  the GDT (Global Descriptor Table). You should set this value to at least
16  selectors,  as DOS/32 Advanced will use  some  of them when loading your
protected  mode  application. Note that some  of the protected mode programs
 may require this value to be  set to a large number, for example 4096.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Callbacks</B> <I>Default: 16</I><BR>
This is the number of callbacks that will be allocated by the DOS Extender
and  that  will  be available through  DPMI  functions  0303h and 0304h. You
should  set  this  value  to at least  8  callbacks  to  ensure that the DOS
Extender  itself will operate properly, even  if you know that the protected
mode program you are running does not use any callbacks at all.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Real Mode Stacks</B> <I>Default: 8</I><BR>
This is the number of the real mode  virtual stacks that will be allocated by
the  DOS  Extender. Whenever a protected mode  code needs to access the real
mode program (for example an interrupt occurs, that has to be passed down to
the  real mode) a virtual stack will be used. When the DOS Extender runs out
of  stacks  (when too many nested calls  are  made) the application will be
terminated with a run-time error message.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Prot. Mode Stacks</B> <I>Default: 8</I><BR>
This is the number of the protected mode virtual stacks that will be allocated
by  the  DOS  Extender.  Whenever a real  mode  program  needs to access the
protected  mode  code  (for  example a  hardware  interrupt  occurs, and the
handler  callbacks  it to the protected mode)  a virtual stack will be used.
When  the  DOS Extender runs out of  stacks  (when too many nested calls are
made) the application will be terminated with a run-time error message.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>VCPI PageTables</B> <I>Default: 64</I><BR>
This  is  the  number of Page Tables  that  will  be  allocated by the DOS
Extender  under VCPI. This value directly  controls how much extended memory
will be allocated by the DOS Extender (under VCPI only) from the system and
made available to your programs. Each Page Table will
map  (translate  physical  addresses  to  linear  addresses)  4MB of memory.
Setting  this  value  to  four will allow  the  DOS  Extender to map 16MB of
memory,  but the four allocated Page Tables will take up 16KB of conventional
(DOS)  memory. The default value is 64, which allows the DOS Extender to map
as  much  as 256MB of the extended  memory.  Note that the DOS Extender will
automatically  check  how much memory can  be allocated at startup, and will
not  create unnecessary Page Tables, ie if this  value is set to 16, but only
8MB  is  physically present in the  machine,  the DOS Extender will allocate
only two Page Tables.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>VCPI PhysTables</B> <I>Default: 2</I><BR>
This is the number of Page Tables  that  will be allocated and used by the DOS
Extender for physical memory mapping  under  VCPI  (DPMI functions 0800h  and
0801h). One Page Table will allow mapping of up to 4MB of memory.
If you are sure that an application does not use physical memory mapping
feature you may set this value to zero, reserving no Page Tables for physical
memory mapping, but freeing up some of DOS conventional memory.
(The   physical  memory  mapping   is  commonly  used  by  SVGA
programmers,  when the video memory can be mapped into linear memory to make
an  illusion  of all the memory on  the video card appearing as a contiguous
block  placed somewhere in the physical memory.) Note that some applications
(games  which  use decent 3D graphics cards)  will require more than 8MB (ie
2-3 PhysTables) to work properly.

<B>Real Mode Stack Length</B> <I>Default: 32</I><BR>
The size of real mode virtual stack in paragraphs (bytes*16).

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Prot. Mode Stack Length</B> <I>Default: 32</I><BR>
The size of protected mode virtual stack in paragraphs (bytes*16).
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<B>Extended Memory</B> <I>Default: All</I><BR>
This option specifies the amount of  extended memory (in bytes) that will
be  allocated by the DOS Extender.  This much memory (if physically present)
will  be  made  available for you protected  mode  program's use. If the DOS
Extender  can  not allocate the specified amount  of  memory, it will try to
allocate as much memory as it can.
