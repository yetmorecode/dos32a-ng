This problem often arises when a DOS/32 Advanced application was spawned

program that spawned DOS/32 Advanced, make sure you have enough extended
memory.</FONT></P>

<P><TT>DOS/32A warning (9001): no extended memory had been allocated </TT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced could
not allocate any extended memory. Note that when an external DPMI host and
a VCPI server are present at the same time, and DOS/32 Advanced is configured
to detect VCPI first, no extended memory can be available due to the fact
that the DPMI host might have already allocated it all. Another possibility
is that a DOS/32 Advanced application was spawned from a software incompatible
with DOS/32 Advanced in the matter of extended memory allocation. Finally,
DOS/32 Advanced might have been configured to not allocate any extended
memory at all. Reconfigure DOS/32 Advanced. Make sure that the software,
from which the application was spawned is DOS/32 Advanced compatible. Replace
memory manager.</FONT></P>

<P><TT>DOS/32A warning (9003): real mode interrupt vector had been modified:
INT %bh </TT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- This warning will be
issued on your protected mode program's exit. It will inform you that the
protected mode program that was just run, did install a real mode interrupt
&quot;%b&quot;, or did modify the real mode interrupt vector table in some
other way, but it did not restore the original value of &quot;%b&quot;.
Note that many protected mode programs do not care for restoring certain
real mode interrupts, such as INT 1Ch, INT 23h and INT 24h. However, since
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender will restore the whole real mode interrupt
vector table on exit to DOS (unless this option is disabled), this will
usually do no harm to the system.</FONT></P>

<P><TT>DOS/32A warning (9004): mouse initialization failed </TT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- Either mouse driver

such Objects from the application, unless they are referenced from somewhere
in the program.</FONT></P>

<P><TT>DOS/32A warning (9006): incompatible version of DOS/32A already running </TT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- This warning will be
issued when spawning a DOS/32 Advanced application from another DOS/32 Advanced
program, and the DOS Extenders' versions are not compatible (ie they have
different versions). Make sure that all the applications that are to be spawned
run under one and the same version of DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender.</FONT></P>
